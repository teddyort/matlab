function varargout = iif(varargin)

% out = iif(conditions_actions)
% 
% This is an inline form of "if", allowing one to use "if" as a function.
% Generally, the form looks like:
%
% iif(<if this>,      <then that>, ...
%     <else if this>, <then that>);
%
% That is, the odd inputs are treated as conditions and the even inputs are
% treated as the actions to be performed. The action corresponding to the 
% first true condition is executed.
%
% For example, consider normalizing a vector, x.
%
% x_hat = iif(all(x == 0), @() x, ...
%             true,        @() x/sqrt(sum(x.^2)))
%
% Consider writing an anonymous function to safely normalize x.
%
% safe_normalize = @(x) iif(all(x == 0), @() x, ...
%                           true,        @() x/sqrt(sum(x.^2)));
%
% To avoid calculating *all* possible conditions before determing which
% action to perform, the conditions can be expressed as anonymous functions
% to execute. These will be executed in order until a condition returning
% true is found. Here the same example as the above, with "@()" added
% before each condition to prevent its execution until it's needed (and
% skipping it altogether when it's not needed). This can be useful for
% conditions that take a long time to evaluate. Note that this syntax is
% likely slower than the above when the conditions are easy to execute.
%
% safe_normalize = @(x) iif(@() all(x == 0), @() x, ...
%                           @() true,        @() x/sqrt(sum(x.^2)));
