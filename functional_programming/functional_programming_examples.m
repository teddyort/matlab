%% Introduction to Functional Programming with Anonymous Functions
%
% The following document was built from posts written for the blog "Loren
% on the Art of MATLAB". The ideas presented below in anonymous functions
% have been written as |.m| files so that they might be placed on the
% MATLAB path. The |.m| versions are the same as below or slightly expanded
% where appropriate.
%
% The best way to view this document is to open it in the MATLAB editor and
% click "Publish" or enter the following at the command line:

%% The Goal
% I use a lot of anonymous functions. They're nice and compact and almost 
% invisible in their simplicity. Plus, if I can write an anonymous function
% to do something, I don't need to write a |.m| file, and that can save me
% from file clutter on larger projects and from having to send someone a
% dozen files instead of sending one clean script. However, it seems at
% first glance like anonymous functions must necessarily be simple. No
% |if... else|, |while|, |for|, or any other keywords can be used. So how
% could we possibly write sophisticated programs in anonymous functions?
% We'll see, and it will involve some ideas from functional programming.
%
% The goal of this introduction is to demonstrate how a few of these
% techniques can change the way we work in MATLAB, allowing greater brevity
% and simultaneously increasing functionality. There are three parts. In
% the first part, we'll present creating functions of functions and
% treating functions as variables (in MATLAB, that means function handles),
% and from there, we'll move on to implementing conditional statements
% (like |if... else|) in anonymous functions. In the next part, we'll add
% recursion and executing multiple statements inside an anonymous function.
% In the final part, we'll develope a loop function. But first, if 
% "function handle" or "anonymous function" is new to you, go check out 
% Loren’s great introductions to those ideas on her blog, Loren on the Art 
% of MATLAB.

% <html><h1><center>Part 1</center></h1></html>

%% Minimum and Maximum Example
% Let's say we want to write a function to find the minimum and maximum of
% a set of numbers and store the results in an array. Here's a first pass:

min_and_max = @(x) [min(x), max(x)];
min_and_max([3 4 1 6 2])

%%
% Our |min_and_max| function takes in an array that we'll call |x|, finds
% the minimum and maximum, and stores the two results in an output array.
% Clear? Good. But now let's make it more difficult. The |min| and |max|
% functions both return _two_ outputs if desired (both the minimum or 
% maximum _and_ the index at which they occur in the input array). Our
% simple |min_and_max| function can't get those secondary outputs! How can
% we access them? Consider this odd-looking line.

[extrema, indices] = cellfun(@(f) f([3 4 1 6 2]), {@min, @max})

%%
% Well, that clearly worked. The minimum, 1, occurs at index 3. The
% maximum, 6, occurs at index 4, but what is this line actually doing?
% First, recall how |cellfun| behaves. The first argument is a _function
% handle_. The second argument is a cell array of whatever. Each element of
% the cell array is given as an argument to the provided function handle.
% Most of the time, that cell array is full of data, and each piece of data
% is passed to the function. However, we could just as easily put function
% handles in the cell array. Then the first function (|@(f) f(...)|) _acts
% on all the other functions_. So, first |@min| is passed in for |f| and
% the outputs from |min([3 4 1 6 2])| are stored. Then, |@max| is passed in
% for |f|, and its outputs are stored.
%
% Ok, now that we're working with functions of functions, let's remove that
% hard-coded |[3 4 1 6 2]| and write a new |min_and_max| function by simply
% adding a |@(x)| out front and changing |[3 4 1 6 2]| to |x|.

min_and_max = @(x) cellfun(@(f) f(x), {@min, @max});

%%
% We can now use |min_and_max| for just the extrema, like before, but we 
% can also get the indices too.

y = randi(10, 1, 10)
just_values        = min_and_max(y)
[~, just_indices]  = min_and_max(y)
[extrema, indices] = min_and_max(y)

%%
% That might have looked a little funny, but it's pretty easy to think
% about, right? Now let's make it look a little nicer too.

%% Map
% Above, we're mapping each function to our input |x|. More generally, we
% might write a "map" function to map a series of functions to the input
% values. We'll make |val| a cell array so we can also send multiple inputs
% to multiple functions all at once. This is like what we had before, but 
% re-arranged a bit.

map = @(val, fcns) cellfun(@(f) f(val{:}), fcns);

%%
% Look how simple this makes |min_and_max| (below), while still accessing
% both outputs. Not only is it shorter to write than any other versions so
% far, it's easier to read, with hardly anything but a single occurrence of
% each variable or function name. "Map |x| to the |min| and |max| 
% functions". No problem.

x = [3 4 1 6 2];
[extrema, indices] = map({x}, {@min, @max})

%%
% Let's try multiple inputs:

map({1, 2}, {@plus, @minus, @times})

%%
% What if outputs are different sizes? We'll write |mapc| (as in MAP with 
% Cell array outputs) to handle this; all it needs is an extra argument to 
% |cellfun| to say that our output isn't uniform in size.

mapc = @(val, fcns) cellfun(@(f) f(val{:}), fcns, 'UniformOutput', false);

%%
% Send |pi| to multiple functions that return differently-sized arrays. The
% first output is a scalar, the second is a scalar, and the third is a 
% string.

mapc({pi}, {@(x) 2 * x, ...                     % Multiply by 2
            @cos, ...                           % Find cosine
            @(x) sprintf('x is %.5f...', x)})   % Return a string

%%
% That takes care of |map|, which we can now use anywhere to send a set of 
% inputs to numerous functions and collect their multiple outputs with
% brief and easy-to-read code.
%
% By the way, writing these *functions that operate on other functions* is
% part of the "functional programming" style, and we're just scratching the
% surface. Let's go a little deeper and see how we can write a function to 
% choose which function to apply from a list of functions.

%% Inline Conditionals
% Sometimes an anonymous function might need a condition, like |if...else|.
% However, normal MATLAB syntax doesn't allow program flow statements like
% these in anonymous functions. Hope it not lost. We can implement an
% "inline if" in a single line:

iif = @(varargin) varargin{2 * find([varargin{1:2:end}], 1, 'first')}();

%%
% Alright, that looks decidedly strange, so before we discuss how it works,
% take a look at how easy it is to use:
%
%     [out1, out2, ...] = iif( if this,      then run this, ...
%                              else if this, then run this, ...
%                              ...
%                              else,         then run this );
%
% All the "if this" conditions should evaluate to true or false. The "then
% run this" action next to the first true condition is executed. None of
% the other actions are executed! We could use this to make, for example, a
% safe normalization function to do the following:
%
% * If not all values of |x| are finite, throw an error.
% * Else if all values of |x| are equal to 0, return zeros.
% * Else, return |x/norm(x)|.
%
% This is implemented below. Note the |@()| out in front of the actions. 
% This means, "don't do this action, but _refer_ to this action". That is,
% we're passing _pieces of code_ to the |iif| function as _arguments_. In
% this way, we aren't actually doing all three things; we'll only call the
% action for the single case we need.

normalize = @(x) iif( ~all(isfinite(x)), @() error('Must be finite!'), ...
                      all(x == 0),       @() zeros(size(x)), ...
                      true,              @() x/norm(x) );
                 
%%
% Test the nominal condition.
normalize([1 1 0])

%%
% Test the error condition with non-finite inputs.
try normalize([0 inf 2]), catch err, disp(err.message); end

%%
% Test the all-zeros condition.
normalize([0 0 0])

%%
% Easy to use, right? We've implemented |if... else| behavior without
% needing an actual |if| or |else| anywhere! So now it's time to see how
% this thing works.
%
% First, the |iif| function takes any number of arguments, thanks to
% |varargin|. These arguments will be condition 1 (true or false), action 1
% (a function), condition 2, action 2, etc. First, the |iif| function
% selects all of the conditions (that's the odd numbered items in
% |varargin|) via |[varargin{1:2:end}]|. For our safe norm, this returns:
%
%     [~all(isfinite(x)), all(x == 0), true]
%
% Next, it finds the index of the first |true| value in those conditions
% with |find(..., 1, 'first')|. E.g., if |~all(isfinite(x))| was |false|,
% but |all(x == 0)| was |true|, the index would be 2.
%
% The actions to perform are the even-numbered items of |varargin|, so we
% just multiply that index by 2 to get the index of the action to perform.
% Finally, we execute the action by appending |()| on the end, as in
%
%     varargin{...}()
% 
% Did you catch what was happening there? We're passing little pieces of
% _code_ as _inputs_ to the |iif| function. _Functions_ as _arguments_. 
% See why this is called "functional" programming? I'll admit it looks 
% weird at first, but once you've seen it, the pattern is hard to forget.

%%
% <html><h1><center>Part 2</center></h1></html>
%
% In Part 1, we said that functional programming was marked by storing
% functions as variables (function handles) and working with functions that
% act on other functions. We put these ideas together to implement our own
% version of a |map| function for handling multiple inputs and outputs from
% multiple functions simultaneously, and we created |iif|, an "inline if",
% to allow the use of conditional statements inside of anonymous functions.
% So how might we work with recursive functions -- functions of themselves?
% We'll see how a functional programming style allows us to implement
% recursive functionality inside anonymous functions, and this will pave
% the way for the final part, in which we'll implement loops, without ever 
% using |for| or |while| (which we can't use in anonymous functions).

%% Anonymous Function Recursion
% Recall that a recursive function is a function that calls itself. It 
% therefore needs some way to refer to itself. When we write an anonymous 
% function, it isn't "named" (hence, "anonymous"), so it can't call itself
% by name. How can we get around this?
%
% Let's start with a Fibonacci sequence example. Recall that the nth number
% of the Fibonacci sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers, 
% starting with 1 and 1, yielding 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc. This is 
% easy to implement recursively.
%
%     fib = @(n) iif(n <= 2, 1, ...                    % First two numbers
%                    true,   @() fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)); % All later numbers
%
% But hey, that can't work! We haven't defined |fib| yet, so how could
% this anonymous function call it? In fact, the anonymous function will
% never "know" we're referring to it as |fib|, so this won't work at all. 
% Therefore, instead of trying to call |fib| directly, let's provide
% another input: the handle of a function to call, |f|.

fib = @(f, n) iif(n <= 2, 1, ...                      % First two numbers            
                  true,   @() f(f, n-1) + f(f, n-2)); % All later numbers

%%
% Getting closer. Now, if we pass |fib| _to_ |fib| along with the number we
% want, it will call |fib|, passing in |fib| as the first argument, 
% recursively until we get our answer.

fib(fib, 6)

%%
% Ok, that's right. The sixth number of the sequence is 8. On the other 
% hand, the syntax we've created is terrible. We have to provide the
% function to itself? I'd rather not. Instead, let's just write a new
% function that hands |fib| to |fib| along with the input |n|.

fib2 = @(n) fib(fib, n);

fib2(4)
fib2(5)
fib2(6)

%%
% That's a lot closer to what we want, but there's one more step. Let's
% write a function called |recur| to hand a function handle to itself, 
% along with any other arguments. This makes recursion less cumbersome.

recur = @(f, varargin) f(f, varargin{:});

%%
% That was simple, so now let's re-write |fib|. The first argument to
% |recur| is the function, which we'll define inline. The second is |n|.
% That's all there is to it. It now reads as "Recursively call a function
% that, if |k <= 2|, returns one, and otherwise returns the recursive
% function of |k-1| plus that of |k-2|, starting with the user's input
% |n|." (If it doesn't read quite this clearly at first, that's ok. It
% takes some getting used to. Comment liberally if necessary!)

fib = @(n) recur(@(f, k) iif(k <= 2, 1, ...
                             true,   @() f(f, k-1) + f(f, k-2)), ...
                 n);

%%
% And we can find the first ten numbers of the sequence via |arrayfun|.

arrayfun(fib, 1:10)

%%
% Factorial (f(n) = 1 * 2 * 3 * ... n) is another easy operation to 
% represent recursively.

factorial = @(n) recur(@(f, k) iif(k == 0, 1, ...
                                   true,   @() k * f(f, k-1)), n);
arrayfun(factorial, 1:7)

%%
% A number to an integer power has a nearly identical form. Here's 
% |4.^(0:5)|.

pow = @(x, n) recur(@(f, k) iif(k == 0, 1, ...
                                true,   @() x * f(f, k-1)), n);
arrayfun(@(n) pow(4, n), 0:5)

%%
% That was a big step for anonymous functions, using both recursion and an
% inline conditional together with ease. Like |map| and |iif|, |recur|, 
% looks strange at first, but once it's been seen, it's hard to forget how 
% it works (just make one of the inputs a function handle and pass it to 
% itself). And recursion doesn't have to stop at interesting mathematical 
% sequences of numbers. For instance, in the next part, we'll use this to 
% implement loops in, but first, we'll need a some helper functions and a
% good way to execute multiple statements in an anonymous function.

%% Helpers
% These little functions are useful in many circumstances, and we're going
% to need |curly| frequently.

paren = @(x, varargin) x(varargin{:});
curly = @(x, varargin) x{varargin{:}};

%%
% They allow us to write |x(3, 4)| as |paren(x, 3, 4)| and similarly for 
% curly braces. That is, now we can think of parentheses and curly braces 
% as functions! At first this might not seem useful. However, imagine 
% writing a function to return the width and height of the screen. The data
% we need is available from this call:

get(0, 'ScreenSize')

%%
% However, we don't need those preceeding ones. We could save the output to
% a variable, say |x|, and then access x(3:4), but if we need this in an
% anonymous function, we can't save to a variable. How do we access just
% elements 3 and 4? There are numerous ways, but |paren| and |curly| are
% similar to constructs found in other languages and are easy to use, so
% we'll use those here.
%
% Now we can write our |screen_size| function to return just the data we
% want.

screen_size = @() paren(get(0, 'ScreenSize'), 3:4);

screen_size()

%%
% While on the subject, note that we can actually use any number of
% indices or even ':'.

magic(3)
paren(magic(3), 1:2, 2:3)
paren(magic(3), 1:2, :)

%%
% We do the same with the curly braces. Here, the regular expression 
% pattern will match both 'rain' and 'Spain', but we'll only select the 
% second match.

spain = curly(regexp('The rain in Spain....', '\s(\S+ain)', 'tokens'), 2)

%%
% It also works with ':' (note that the single quotes are required).

[a, b] = curly({'the_letter_a', 'the_letter_b'}, ':')

%% Executing Multiple Statements
% With |curly| in place, let's examine something a little different.
% Consider the following:

do_three_things = @() {fprintf('This is the first thing.\n'), ...
                       fprintf('This is the second thing.\n'), ...
                       max(eig(magic(3)))};
                   
do_three_things()

%%
% We've executed three statements on a single line. All of the outputs are
% stored in the cell array (note that the output from |fprintf| is a
% number, but we don't care what it means here).
%
% Let's say we want to write a function to:
% 
% # Create a small figure in the middle of the screen
% # Plot some random points
% # Return the handles of the figure and the plot
%
% Then by storing all of the outputs in a cell array and using |curly| to
% access the outputs we care about, we can make a multi-line function with
% multiple outputs, all in a simple anonymous funciton.

dots = @() curly({...
    figure('Position', [0.5*screen_size() - [100 50], 200, 100], ...
           'MenuBar',  'none'), ...                % Position the figure
    plot(randn(1, 100), randn(1, 100), '.')}, ...  % Plot random points
    ':');                                          % Return everything

[h_figure, h_dots] = dots()

%%
% (As a quick aside, note that if a statement doesn't return anything, we
% can't put it in a cell array, and so we can't use it this way. There are
% ways around this; one is to use the included |void| function. See |help
% void| for details.)

%%
% That takes care of recursion and multi-line statements in anonymous 
% functions, so now we're ready for loops.

close all;

%%
% <html><h1><center>Part 3</center></h1></html>

%% Loops
% Note that the recursive sequences we created in the last part could also
% have been implemented with |for| loops. For instance, here's factorial 
% of |n|:
% 
%     factorial = 1;
%     for k = 1:n
%         factorial = k * factorial;
%     end
% 
% Many times, recursive functions can be written iteratively in loops.
% However, we can't use |for| or |while| in an anonymous function, so 
% instead of asking how we can unwrap recursive functions into iterative 
% loops, let's ask the reverse: how can we implement loops with recursive 
% functions?

%% Loops via Recursion
% To loop properly, one must know:
% 
% * What to do each iteration
% * If the process should continue to the next iteration
% * What's available when the loop begins
% 
% Allowing the "what to do" to be a function (|fcn|) of some state (|x|),
% the "if it should continue" to be another function (|cont|) of the state,
% and "what's available when the loop begins" to be the initial state 
% (|x0|), we can write a |loop| function.
%
% On each step, the loop function will call the |cont| function. If that 
% returns false (i.e., we shouldn't continue), the current state, |x|, is 
% returned. Otherwise, if we _should_ continue, it calls |fcn| on the 
% current state, and passes the output from that to the next iteration. 
% Letting this single iteration be denoted as |f|, it's easy to build the 
% anonymous function |loop| using our |recur| function.

loop = @(x0, cont, fcn) ...                                 % Header
       recur(@(f, x) iif( ~cont(x), x, ...                  % Continue?
                          true,     @() f(f, fcn(x)) ), ... %   Iterate
             x0);                                           % from x0.

%%
% For this trivial example, the state is simply the iteration count. We'll
% increase the count every iteration until the count |>= n| and return the
% final count. All this does therefore is count from 0 to the input n. Not 
% very interesting, but it demonstrates the loop.

count = @(n) loop(0, ...            % Initialize state, k, to 0
                  @(k) k < n, ...   % While k < n
                  @(k) k + 1);      %   k = k + 1

arrayfun(count, 1:10)

%%
% Recall from the last part that we can implement multiple statements 
% inside a cell array and can then return whatever output we need. We'll
% use that technique here to make our loops have more complex behavior.
% 
% In the example below, the state is still the iteration count, but on
% each iteration, we'll print something out, storing its result (a number)
% in the first position of a cell array, and we'll add 1 to |k|, storing 
% the result in the second position. We'll use |curly| to return only the 
% second position. In this way, on every iteration, we'll print something 
% and update the counter. Here's the pseudocode.
%
%     Set k to 1.
%     While k <= 4
%       Print something out.
%       Store k+1.             <- Return this value as k
%     End
%
% The code then proceeds this way:

pets = {'cat', 'dog', 'bird', 'fish'};
describe_pet = @(pet) fprintf('I have a %s.\n', pet);

declare_my_pets = @() loop(...              % Loop
    1, ...                                  % From k = 1
    @(k) k <= 4, ...                        % While k <= 4
    @(k) curly({ describe_pet(pets{k}), ... %   Step 1: Print something
                 k + 1 }, ...               %   Step 2: Add 1 to k
               2));                         %   Return output from step 2

% Call our anonymous function that loops.
declare_my_pets();

%%
% I'll be the first to admit that the loop is a bit longer and much more 
% rigid than a normal MATLAB loop. On the other hand, it can be used in
% anonymous functions, and its syntax has a certain cleanliness to it in
% that it doesn't modify any variables that live outside the loop; it has
% its own scope. This is one nice feature of |loop| being a _function_ that
% takes _code_ (functions) as arguments.
%
% Consider that the state we're using could be anything, whether a simple 
% scalar that keeps a count of the number of iterations like those above, a
% cell array holding multiple values, a structure, or even an object. We'll
% use and update this state on every iteration. When we're done, the state 
% is returned. Before we show the use of more complex states though, let's
% first make a better loop.

%% A Better Loop
% Let's make handling the state a bit easier. If instead of handing |x|
% into the functions, we let |x| be a cell array of arguments to those
% functions, things get a little easier to use. Then, |fcn| must return a
% cell array of arguments to the next call to |fcn| or |cont|. All we have
% to do to implement this is append |{:}| to the end of |x| when we use it.
% The |factorial| example below makes this much clearer.
%
% As one final convenience, instead of returning the full state at the
% very end, we'll add a |cleanup| function to only return the important
% parts of the state. For instance, the state might contain an iteration 
% counter, but we don't need this after the loop is done, so the
% |cleanup| will simply not return this part.

loop = @(x0, cont, fcn, cleanup) ...                            % Header
       recur(@(f, x) iif(~cont(x{:}), cleanup(x{:}), ...        % Continue?
                         true,        @() f(f, fcn(x{:}))), ... %   Iterate
             x0);                                               % from x0.

%%
% For this implementation of factorial, we'll keep our iteration count,
% |k|, and the previous products, |x|, in a cell array. According to the
% change we made above, this means |x| and |k| will be handed to our
% functions now.

factorial = @(n) loop({1, 1}, ...         % Start with k = 1 and x = 1
                      @(k,x) k <= n, ...  % While k <= n
                      @(k,x) {k + 1, ...  %   k = k + 1;
                              k * x}, ... %   x = k * x;
                      @(k,x) x);          % End, returning x

% First 7 numbers of the factorial sequence
arrayfun(factorial, 1:7)

% As a practical note, recall that because these loops use recursion,
% there's a limit to the number of times they can loop (MATLAB has a
% recursion limit, which is a setting in Preferences). Also, a recursive
% implementation of a loop isn't the most efficient. For this reason, it's
% best to implement |loop| as a |.m| file that can then be used in the same
% way.
% 
%     function x = loop(x, cont, f, cleanup)
%         while ~cont(x{:})
%             x = f(x{:});
%         end
%         if nargin == 4
%             x = cleanup(x{:});
%         end
%     end

% This brings us to our final example. Below, we'll simulate a simple
% harmonic oscillator, using a structure to store dissimilar states,
% including a complete time history of the oscillator.

% First, calculate a state transition matrix that represents a harmonic
% oscillator with damping.
Phi = expm(0.5*[0 1; -1 -0.2]);

% Now create the loop.
x   = loop({[1; 0], 1}, ...                  % Initial state
           @(x,k) k <= 100, ...              % While k <= 100
           @(x,k) {[x, Phi * x(:, end)], ... %   Update x
                   k + 1}, ...               %   Update k
           @(x,k) x);                        % End, return x

% Create a plot function.
plot_it = @(n, x, y, t) {subplot(2, 1, n), ...            % Select subplot.
                         plot(x), ...                     % Plot the data.
                         iif(nargin==4, @() title(t), ... % If there's a
                             true,        []), ...        % title, add it.
                         ylabel(y), ...                   % Label y
                         xlabel('Time (s)')};             % and x axes.

% Plot the result.

% That's it for loops via recursion!

%% Summary
% Let's look back at what we did over these three parts. First, we started
% with a simple |map| utility function to demonstrate the
% function-of-functions idea. Then we created our ubiquitous inline if,
% which further enabled recursion (a conditional is necessary to make
% recursion stop!). We also showed using multiple statements by storing
% their outputs in a cell array. Finally, we created a |loop| construct on 
% top of our recursion functions. Here they are as brief anonymous
% function.

map   = @(val, fcns) cellfun(@(f) f(val{:}), fcns);
mapc  = @(val, fcns) cellfun(@(f) f(val{:}), fcns, 'UniformOutput', false);
iif   = @(varargin) varargin{2*find([varargin{1:2:end}], 1, 'first')}();
recur = @(f, varargin) f(f, varargin{:});
paren = @(x, varargin) x(varargin{:});
curly = @(x, varargin) x{varargin{:}};
loop  = @(x,c,f,r) recur(@(g,y) iif(~c(y{:}),r(y{:}),1,@()g(g,f(y{:}))),x);

%% 
% At this point, we've done more than just scratch the surface of 
% functional programming. We've used MATLAB's interesting constructs, such 
% as function handles, cell arrays, and |varargin| to implement a 
% functional programming framework, allowing a new syntax within MATLAB,
% where code can be arguments to flow control functions.
%
% Thanks for reading. I hope this has both enabled a new level of detail in
% anonymous functions in MATLAB and helped demonstrate the wide range of
% possibilities available within the MATLAB language.
%
% Enjoy!
