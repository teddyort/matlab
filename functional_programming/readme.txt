Functional Programming Constructs


Thanks for downloading these functional programming constructs. I hope they
make your anonymous functions more sophisticated and your normal code a
little smoother. Please take care when using the styles proposed in the 
examples to comment liberally and use whitespace for maximum clarity. 
The functional programming style has a tendency to become rapidly complex
and unreadable, but that is ultimately up to the programmer.

The best place to get started is to navigate (in MATLAB) to the location of
this readme and then enter the following in the MATLAB command window:

open(['html' filesep 'functional_programming_examples.html'])

Each included file includes help and examples as well. E.g., for help on 
the 'use' function, try:

help use
