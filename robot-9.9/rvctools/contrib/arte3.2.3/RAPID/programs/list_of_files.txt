- basic_robot_program.m: Just go to four different target points in simulation.
- basic.prg: The above script translated to a RAPID program.

- practice_1_programming.m: in order to run the program. Type:
    >> init_lib 
    >> robot=load_robot('abb', 'IRB140');
    >> teach
            Click on Load end Tool and load the arte/robots/equipment/end_tools/parallel_gripper_0 that defines a parallel gripper.
            Click on Load equipment and load arte/robots/equipment/tables/table_two_areas that represents a conveyor belt with two workin areas.
        	Click on Load a piece and load arte/robots/equipment/cylinders/cilynder_tiny that represents a piece.
-pract_pr.prg: the above script translated to RAPID.The robot can be programmed with this RAPID file.
