%   LOAD_ROBOT Loads a data structure corresponding to the specified robot.
%
%
% 	robot = LOAD_ROBOT(MANUFACTURER, VERSION) returns a robot data
% 	structure of the specified robot.  Each robot parameters' are stored in
% 	the directory named robots/manufacturer/version. For example:  
%
%   Example: 
%   robot =  load_robot('ABB', 'IRB140')
%
%   gets the available data for the ABB IRB140 robotic arm whose
%   parameters are stored in the directory robots/ABB/IRB140
%   
%   robot = LOAD_ROBOT(PATH) specifies a relative path to the robots
%   directory. For example:
%   robot =  load_robot('ABB/IRB140')
%
%   robot = LOAD_ROBOT() with no arguments opens a dialog box to select a
%   robot's parameters file.
%
%
%   Execute
%   SUPPORTED_ROBOTS to see a list of all supported robots.
%
%   The robot data structure consists of the following fields:
%
%	See also SUPPORTED_ROBOTS.
