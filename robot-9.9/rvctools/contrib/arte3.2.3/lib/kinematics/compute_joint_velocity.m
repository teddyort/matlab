% COMPUTE_JOINT_VELOCITY computes the velocity of the joint given the velocity
% vector V of the end effector
%
%   If robot.J is defined the Inverse Jacobian is evaluated to compute a given
%   velocity. The result depends on the definition of J.
%
%   On the other hand, if robot.J is an empty array a conventional Jacobian
%   is computed instead. The resulting joint speeds is computed as
%   qd = inv(J)*V, where V is the velocity vector expressed in the base reference frame.
%
%   See also COMPUTE_JACOBIAN.
