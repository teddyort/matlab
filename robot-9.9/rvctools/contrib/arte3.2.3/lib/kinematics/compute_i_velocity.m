% V = compute_i_velocity(robot, q, qd, i)
%
% COMPUTE_i_VELOCITY computes the velocity V of the i reference system
% as a function of the joint coordinates q and joint speeds qd.
%
%   If robot.J is defined the Jacobian is evaluated to compute a given
%   velocity. robot.J should be defined as a character string as a function of 
%   the parameters theta, d, a and alpha. The result depends on the
%   definition of J. In consequence, J should be a 6xDOF matrix. For
%   example, for a 2DOF planar arm J is a 6x2 matrix.
%
%   On the other hand, if robot.J is an empty array a conventional Jacobian
%   is computed instead. The compute_conventional_jacobian function is then 
%   called. The result V is then V = [vn wn]' where vn is the
%   linear speed of the end effector and wn is the angular speed, both
%   expressed in the base coordinate system of the robot. 
%   
%   In any case, this speed (m/s, rad/s)
%   is computed as:
%   
%   V=J(:,1:i)*qd(1:i)
%
%   being qd the joint speeds (rotational or translational) of each joint. 
%   Thus, once J is computed, it is reduced to include only a subpart of
%   the contribution of the Jacobian for the given joint speeds.
%
%   Example:
%   
%   robot=load_robot('example','3dofplanar')
%
%   See also COMPUTE_CONVENTIONAL_JACOBIAN.
