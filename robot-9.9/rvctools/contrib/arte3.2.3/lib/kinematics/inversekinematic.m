%   INVERSEKINEMATIC	Inverse kinematic for serial robots.
%
% 	q = INVERSEKINEMATIC(robot, T) 
%   returns the vector q of joint values according to the transformation matrix
%   of the end effector T.
%
%   INVERSEKINEMATIC calls a pre-defined function specified by ROBOT.inversekinematic_fn that
%   should be implemented in the inversekinematic directory.
%
%	See also DIRECTKINEMATIC.
