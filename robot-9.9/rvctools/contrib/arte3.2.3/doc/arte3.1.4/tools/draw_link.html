   DRAW_LINK(ROBOT, I, T) 

   Draws the I link of the robot according to the transformation matrix T,
   where:
   ROBOT is the current object storing the robot parameters. The graphical
   representation of the robot is stored in the variables 
   robot.graphical.link{1}.v --&gt; robot base
   robot.graphical.link{2}.v --&gt; link 1...

   If the robot has graphics the variable robot.graphical.has_graphics
   must be set.

   I is the current link number being drawn.

   T is the global transformation that relates the base reference system
   of the robot with the link's reference system.

   If the variable robot.graphical.draw_axes is set, the reference system
   associated with link i is drawn with arrows X (red), Y (green), Z (blue)
