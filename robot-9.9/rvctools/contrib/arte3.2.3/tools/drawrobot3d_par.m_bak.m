% DRAWROBOT3D_par(ROBOT, Q)	
% 3D drawing with DH reference systems for a parallel robot.
% The parallel robot is divided into different serial arms, drawn altogether
% 
% If the robot possesses 3D graphics, the function DRAW_LINK is called to represent
% the link in 3D. Otherwise a line connecting each consecutive reference
% system is plotted.
%
% See also DRAWROBOT3D, DENAVIT, DIRECTKINEMATIC, DRAW_LINK.
