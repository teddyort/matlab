% [F, V, C] = STL_READ(filename)
% Read all the vertex contained in the FILENAME STL .
% (Standard Tessellation Language) file 
% Refer to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_%28file_format%29 for more
% details.
% 
% [F, V, C] = STL_READ(filename) returns:
%   F defines the faces in numbers.
%   V defines the cartesian coordinates of each of the faces. These coordinates are
%       expressed in meters in the links DH reference frame.
%   C is not currently used.
