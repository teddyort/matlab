% q=inversekinematic_Maryland3DOF(robot,T)
% Inverse kinematics for the Maryland 3DOF parallel robot.
%
% T: homogeneous matrix
% robot: structure with arm parameters
% returns: all possible solutions for q = [Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q5 Q6 Q7 Q8] 
% that place the end effectors at the position specified by T.
% 
%
% The movements of this robot is the same as the Delta robot, only
% differing in the configuration of the joints.
%
% This robot is divided into three different 3DOF spherical arms.
%
%  
% Any Qi is a 9 value vector that contains: 
% Qi=[theta1 phi11 phi12 theta2 phi21 phi22 theta3 phi31 phi32]'
% being theta1, phi11 phi12 the joint variables of the first arm
%  and  theta2 phi21 phi22 the joint variables of the second arm
%  and  theta3 phi31 phi32 the joint variables of the third arm
%
% Eight possible solutions q = [Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q5 Q6 Q7 Q8],
% generally called elbow out and elbow in in eight different combinations for
% each of the three arms, as described in the following table:
%  
%               Arm 1       Arm 2      Arm 3
%   Sol 1        0           0          0   
%   Sol 2        0           0          1
%   Sol 3        0           1          0
%   Sol 4        0           1          1
%   Sol 5        1           0          0
%   Sol 6        1           0          1
%   Sol 7        1           1          0
%   Sol 8        1           1          1
