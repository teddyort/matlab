% DIRECTKINEMATIC_3RRR(robot, Q)
% Q: joints vector with structure: 
% [theta1 beta1 delta1 theta2 beta2 delta2 theta3 beta3 delta3]
% theta is the active joint´s vector
% beta is the passive joint's vector in the arm plan
% theta is the passive joint's vector out of the arm plan
% robot: structure with arm parameters
% returns: T solution. 
% shows T1 and T2 with the 2 posible solution. T1 it´s unachievable
