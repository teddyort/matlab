% Q = inversekinematic_5R(robot, T)
% Inverse kinematics for the 5R planar parallel robot
% The 5R robot is divided into two different 2DOF arms.
% INVERSEKINEMATIC_5R(robot, T)
% T: homogeneous matrix
% robot: structure with arm parameters
% returns: all possible solutions for q = [Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4] 
% that place the end effectors at the position specified by T. 
% Any Qi is a 4 value vector that contains: Qi={q1 fi1, q2, fi2},
%
% where q1, fi1, are the joint variables of the first arm
%  and  q2, fi2, the joint variables of the second arm
%
% Four possible solutions q = [Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4],
% generally called elbow up and elbow down in four different combinations
% for the two different arms.
