%   q = inversekinematic_3dofsphericalb(robot, T)
%
%   Inverse kinematics for the 3dof spherical robot
%   
% robot: structure with arm parameters
% T: homogeneous matrix
% returns: all possible solutions for q = [theta phi1 phi2] that place the end effector at the
% position specified by T. Two possible solutions are returned,
% generally called elbow up and elbow down:
%  
% FIRST column contains the elbow up solution
% SECOND column contains elbow down solution
%
%   This arm is used in the definition of the Delta and Maryland parallel
%   manipulators. Thus, the definition considers that the first joint is an
%   active rotational joint whereas the others two are passive joints.
