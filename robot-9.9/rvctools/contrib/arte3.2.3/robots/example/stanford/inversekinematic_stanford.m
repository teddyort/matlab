%   Q = INVERSEKINEMATIC_STANFORD(robot, T)	
%   Solves the inverse kinematic problem for the STANFORD robot
%   where:
%   robot stores the robot parameters.
%   T is an homogeneous transform that specifies the position/orientation
%   of the end effector.
%
%   A call to Q=INVERSEKINEMATIC_STANFORD returns 4 possible solutions, thus,
%   Q is a 6x4 matrix where each column stores 6 feasible joint values. Of
%   the more general 8 possible solutions, only the 4 that are physically
%   realizable are returned. This is a consequence of the third
%   translational axis that, because of its construction, does not allow
%   negative displacements.

%   Example code:

%   q = [0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1];	
%   T = directkinematic(robot, q);
%   %Call the inversekinematic for this robot
%   qinv = inversekinematic(robot, T);
%   check that all of them are feasible solutions!
%   and every Ti equals T
%   for i=1:8,
%        Ti = directkinematic(robot, qinv(:,i))
