%   This function is called from the simulate_2dofrobot simulink model.
%   This function receives as inputs the initial and final desired
%   joint positions q, and the desired initial and final desired joint
%   speeds qd. Also, the total time spent in the movement is specified from
%   the simulink model. 
%   
%   When the current time is zero, the values of the coefficients k of qd_t
%   qd_t and qdd_t are computed. Next, at each call of the function, the
%   current values of q_t, qd_t and qdd_t are computed.
