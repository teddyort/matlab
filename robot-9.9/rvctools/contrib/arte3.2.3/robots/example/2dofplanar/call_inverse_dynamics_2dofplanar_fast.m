%  tau = call_inverse_dynamics_2dofplanar_fast(input)
%  Auxiliar function for the simulink model SIMULATE_ROBOT_2DOF.
%  Rearranges the inputs coming from the simulink model and calls the
%  function inverse_dynamics_2dof_planar_fast.
%  As a result the instantaneous acceleration at each joint is returned.
%
%  See also inverse_dynamic
