% Inverse kinematics for the 3RRR planar parallel robot
% The 3RRR robot is divided into three different 2DOF arms.
%
% INVERSEKINEMATIC_3RRR(robot, T)
% T: homogeneous matrix
% robot: structure with arm parameters
% returns: all possible solutions for q = [Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q5 Q6 Q7 Q8] 
% that place the end effectors at the position specified by T. 
% Any Qi is a 4 value vector that contains: Qi={q1 fi1, q2, fi2, q3, fi3},
% being q1, fi1, the joint variables of the first arm
%  and  q2, fi2, the joint variables of the second arm
%  and  q3, fi3, the joint variables of the second arm
%
% Eight possible solutions q = [Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q5 Q6 Q7 Q8],
% generally called elbow up and elbow down in eight different combinations for
% each of the three arms, as described in the following table:
%  
%               Arm 1       Arm 2      Arm 3
%   Sol 1        0           0          0   
%   Sol 2        0           0          1
%   Sol 3        0           1          0
%   Sol 4        0           1          1
%   Sol 5        1           0          0
%   Sol 6        1           0          1
%   Sol 7        1           1          0
%   Sol 8        1           1          1
%
%       1: elbow up solution
%       0: elbow down solution
