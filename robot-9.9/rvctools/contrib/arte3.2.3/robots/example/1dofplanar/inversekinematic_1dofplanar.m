% Inverse kinematics for the 2dof planar robot
% T: homogeneous matrix
% robot: structure with arm parameters
% returns: all possible solutions or q = [q1 q2] that place the end effectors at the
% position specified by T. Two possible solutions q1 and q2 are returned,
% generally called elbow up and elbow down.
