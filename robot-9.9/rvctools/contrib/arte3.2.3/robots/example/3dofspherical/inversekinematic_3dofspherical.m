% Inverse kinematics for the 3dof spherical robot
% T: homogeneous matrix
% robot: structure with arm parameters
% returns: all possible solutions for q = [theta beta delta] that place the end effectors at the
% position specified by T. Two possible solutions are returned,
% generally called elbow in and elbow out:
%  
% FIRST column contain elbow OUT solution
% SECOND column contains elbow IN solution
