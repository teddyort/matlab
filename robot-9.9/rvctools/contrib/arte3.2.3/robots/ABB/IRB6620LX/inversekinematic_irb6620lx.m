%   Q = INVERSEKINEMATIC_IRB6620LX(robot, T)	
%   Solves the inverse kinematic problem for the ABB IRB 6620LX robot
%   where:
%   robot stores the robot parameters.
%   T is an homogeneous transform that specifies the position/orientation
%   of the end effector.
%
%   A call to Q=INVERSEKINEMATIC_IRB6620LX returns 4 possible solutions, thus,
%   Q is a 6x4 matrix where each column stores 6 feasible joint values.
%
%   
%   Example code:
%
%   robot=load_robot('ABB', 'IRB6620LX');
%   q = [0 0 0 0 0 0];	
%   T = directkinematic(abb, q);
%   %Call the inversekinematic for this robot
%   qinv = inversekinematic(robot, T);
%   check that all of them are feasible solutions!
%   and every Ti equals T
%   for i=1:4,
%        Ti = directkinematic(robot, qinv(:,i))
%   end
