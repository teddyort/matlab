%   Q = INVERSEKINEMATIC_IRB760(robot, T)	
%   Solves the inverse kinematic problem for the ABB IRB 760 robot
%   where:
%   robot stores the robot parameters.
%   T is an homogeneous transform that specifies the position/orientation
%   of the end effector.
%
%   A call to Q=INVERSEKINEMATIC_IRB760 returns only 1 possible solution, thus,
%   Q is a 5x1 matrix where each column stores 5 feasible joint values.
%   Beware that the 4th axis is a combination of q(2) and q(3).
%
%   
%   Example code:
%
%   >>abb=load_robot('ABB', 'IRB760');
%   >>q = [0 0 0 0 0 0];	
%   >>T = directkinematic(abb, q);
%   %Call the inversekinematic for this robot
%   >>qinv = inversekinematic(abb, T);
%   check that all of them are feasible solutions!
%   and every Ti equals T
%
%   for i=1:8,
%        Ti = directkinematic(abb, qinv(:,i))
%   end
