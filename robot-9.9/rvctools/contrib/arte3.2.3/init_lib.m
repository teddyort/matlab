%   Initialization file
%   The script creates the global variables: configuration and robot
%
%   The configuration variable stores parameters related to the simulation,
%   such as:
%   configuration.delta_time: Is the step time in seconds used to move the
%       robot. The time is thus discretized in small steps of size delta_time.
%       Selecting configuration.delta_time=0.01 usually results in a fair
%       simulation. Select larger values, such as delta_time=0.1 if you
%       experience that the simulation is too slow.
%   
%   configuration.time_delay: During a simulation, the robot is drawn at different
%       positions at the Matlab's plot. For example, to simulate a trajectory, 
%       the robot is drawn with different joint values at a particular sequence.
%       After drawing the robot at a particular pose, the system waits for time_delay
%       seconds, so that the figure can be observed by the user. Depending
%       on the system, values near  configuration.time_delay=0.001 are
%       correct. Please, increase  configuration.delta_time and configuration.time_delay
%       if you are not able to visualize the simulation smoothly.

%     To begin with, try loading a robot:
%     >> robot = load_robot('ABB','IRB140');
%
%     Next, draw it on its zero position:
%     >> drawrobot3d(robot,[0 0 0 0 0 0])
%
%     Next, try a different pose:
%     >> drawrobot3d(robot,[0 pi/2 -pi/2 0 0 0])
%
%     Finally, use the teach pendant to move the robot:
%     >> teach
%
%   Please, type:
%   >> configuration.delta_time=0.1 
%   if you find that the simulation is running too slow.
%
%   Please, type:
%   >> configuration.time_delay = 0.01;
%   if the simulation plot does not show the robot correctly.
